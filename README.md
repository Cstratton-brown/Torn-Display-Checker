# Torn-Display-Checker
Javascript function to be used in google scripts in combination with a google sheet spreadsheet to automate the tracking of plushies and flowers within your display case for the online browser based game Torn.
The code checks all user displays based of the user IDs entered into the script and then returns the name and amount of each flower and plushie that is contained within the display case and then inputs the quantaty values into a spreadsheet.
Uses two JSON files formatted as .html that contain the list of items and their collumn location in the spreadsheet to reference against display cases as well as to contain the user IDs to check the display cases of and the rows their plushie and flower counts are to be inserted at.
